# 3D-MIP
This Python script reads a series of DICOM files, reconstructs a 3D volume, resamples it to isotropic spacing, and generates a sequence of Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) images by rotating the volume around a specified axis (X, Y, or Z). It leverages PyTorch and Kornia for efficient, GPU-accelerated 3D rotation and processing.

Output as follows.
